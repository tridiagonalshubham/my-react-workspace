<a alt="Nx logo" href="https://nx.dev" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrwl/nx/master/images/nx-logo.png" width="45"></a>

✨ A repository showcasing key [Nx](https://nx.dev) features for React monorepos ✨

## 📦 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates a production-ready React monorepo with:

- **2 Applications**

  - `shop` - React e-commerce application with product listings and detail views
  - `api` - Backend API serving product data

- **7 Libraries**

  - `@org/shop-feature-products` - Product listing feature (React)
  - `@org/shop-feature-product-detail` - Product detail feature (React)
  - `@org/shop-data` - Data access layer for shop features
  - `@org/shop-shared-ui` - Shared UI components
  - `@org/models` - Shared data models
  - `@org/api-products` - API product service library
  - `@org/shared-test-utils` - Shared testing utilities

- **E2E Testing**
  - `shop-e2e` - Playwright tests for the shop application

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd <your-repository-name>

# Install dependencies
npx install

# Serve the React shop application (this will simultaneously serve the API backend)
npx nx serve shop

# ...or you can serve the API separately
npx nx serve api

# Build all projects
npx nx run-many -t build

# Run tests
npx nx run-many -t test

# Lint all projects
npx nx run-many -t lint

# Run e2e tests
npx nx e2e shop-e2e

# Run tasks in parallel

npx nx run-many -t lint test build e2e --parallel=3

# Visualize the project graph
npx nx graph
```

## ⭐ Featured Nx Capabilities

This repository showcases several powerful Nx features:

### 1. 🔒 Module Boundaries

Enforces architectural constraints using tags. Each project has specific dependencies it can use:

- `scope:shared` - Can be used by all projects
- `scope:shop` - Shop-specific libraries
- `scope:api` - API-specific libraries
- `type:feature` - Feature libraries
- `type:data` - Data access libraries
- `type:ui` - UI component libraries

**Try it out:**

```bash
# See the current project graph and boundaries
npx nx graph

# View a specific project's details
npx nx show project shop --web
```

### 2. 🎭 Playwright E2E Testing

End-to-end testing with Playwright is pre-configured:

```bash
# Run e2e tests
npx nx e2e shop-e2e

# Run e2e tests in CI mode
npx nx e2e-ci shop-e2e
```

### 3. ⚡ Vitest for Unit Testing

Fast unit testing with Vitest for React libraries:

```bash
# Test a specific library
npx nx test shop-data

# Test all projects
npx nx run-many -t test
```

### 4. 🔧 Self-Healing CI

The CI pipeline includes `nx fix-ci` which automatically identifies and suggests fixes for common issues:

```bash
# In CI, this command provides automated fixes
npx nx fix-ci
```

This feature helps maintain a healthy CI pipeline by automatically detecting and suggesting solutions for:

- Missing dependencies
- Incorrect task configurations
- Cache invalidation issues
- Common build failures

## 🏷️ Understanding Tags

This repository uses tags to enforce module boundaries:

| Project                 | Tags                         | Can Import From              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `shop`                  | `scope:shop`                 | `scope:shop`, `scope:shared` |
| `api`                   | `scope:api`                  | `scope:api`, `scope:shared`  |
| `shop-feature-products` | `scope:shop`, `type:feature` | `scope:shop`, `scope:shared` |
| `shop-data`             | `scope:shop`, `type:data`    | `scope:shared`               |
| `models`                | `scope:shared`, `type:data`  | Nothing (base library)       |

## 🎯 Adding New Features

### Generate a new React application:

```bash
npx nx g @nx/react:app my-app
```

### Generate a new React library:

```bash
npx nx g @nx/react:lib my-lib
```

### Generate a new React component:

```bash
npx nx g @nx/react:component my-component --project=my-lib
```

### Generate a new API library:

```bash
npx nx g @nx/node:lib my-api-lib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to see all available plugins and `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to see all generators for a specific plugin.
